This is my submission in the IEEE Avenir competition. 

The theme was "What will happen in a 100 years".
So my interpretation was
in a decade, many countries will be submerged under water
In the next 25 years, many countries will face serious problems because of Global Warming, which will cause downfall of various countries
In the next 50 years, all the countries will be disbanded and a supreme power will reign over them, their main task would be equality
In the next 100 years, the world will be a much better place to live in, with a pollution-free environment, no poverty, no terrorism, just pure bliss.
